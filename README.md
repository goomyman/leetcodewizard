# Leet Code Wizard
Study examples and a website to learn how to pass leet code interviews

The goal of this is to help teach others and provide learning materials for leet code.   

I highly recommend AI tools such as <a href="https://www.chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a> for design and detailed examples.   

For System Design I highly recommend the books "System Design" and "System Design Interview Volume 2" by Alex Yu & Sahn Lam

TLDR:  Feel free to to use, fork, study, or use it anyway you want,  just dont try to profit off it commercially as the idea is to share, build on ideas, and help others.  Providing credit helps provide exposer :).
